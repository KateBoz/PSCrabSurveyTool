# 12/7/2021 - Notes file for the Crab Survey Tool 
Attendees: Daniel, Matt, Katelyn

ToDo: 
  1. spatial base file generation / collection
    a. Hex grid at some level resolution (100m, 500m) (shapefile)
    b. Management layers (shapefile)
      i. Catch Areas
      ii. Crab Management Regions
      iii. Tribal exlusive areas
      iv. (future) navigation/safety/ etc. exlusion areas
    c. Depth (raster brick)
      i. DEM
      ii. King County Countours
   
   2. Tool Features
    a. Input -> depth range
        Output -> grid centepoint of array points meeting test criteria.
        Secondary Output -> secondary and tertiary survey points for each survey criterion. 
    b. Customizeable depth bins breaks
      i. three bins initially
    c. Definable areas
      i. drop down list for catch area/tribal area/ crab management region
      
  3 User Interface Mockup (MN) 
    a. working interface with no function for design purposes.
      
  4. Final product fuction around attribute data of constitutent layers rather than be geo referenced. 
    a. store georeference (center point) coordinates as a string field.
